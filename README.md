Hi!

As I was in the dining hall today, I noticed that I knew the names of many many students sitting around. I then began to wonder: what is the maximum degrees of separation between any two Carleton students? What is the most numbers of conversations that would happen for gossip to travel to the far corners of the student body.  

Anyway this will help me to understand how long it will take for this form and its results to spread across the entire campus (any results I get from this won't have names attached when its published). If you would take a second to fill this out and share it with a few friends, that would be greatly appreciated.
